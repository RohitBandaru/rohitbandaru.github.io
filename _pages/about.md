I currently work at Google as a Machine Learning Software Engineer (all opinions and content are my own and do not reflect my employer)

My goal with this blog is to explain different areas of AI research. This will help us stay updated on an incredibly fast-moving field. I want to dig deep into papers and understand what makes certain models or algorithms actually work, and think of ideas for future research. I find it very satisfying to go as deep as possible into a topic and reach the edge of documented knowledge.

Writing something also forces you to really understand it. When I write about a research paper, I find interesting details and ideas that I wouldn't have from simply reading it. Thinking deeply on how things works also leads to valuable insights. I want to present deep dives into research and elucidate details that may not be clear in a single read.

I am interested in many different areas of deep learning research. I also enjoy learning about non-AI topics such as genomics, climate change, and neuroscience.
