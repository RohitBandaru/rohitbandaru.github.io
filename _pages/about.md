I currently work at Google as a Machine Learning Software Engineer (all opinions and content are my own and do not reflect my employer)

My goal with this blog is to explain different areas of AI research. This will help us stay update on an incredibly fast moving field. However, I am not interested in simple paper summaries. I want to dig deep into papers and understand what makes certain models or algorithms work, and think of ideas for future research.

The process of writing something also increases the understanding of the topic greatly. When I write about a research paper, I find interesting details and ideas that I would not have from simply reading it. I want to present deep dives into research and elucidate details that may not be clear in a single read.

I focus on deep learning research with a focus on computer vision. I also enjoy learning about non-AI topics such as genomics, climate change, and neuroscience.
